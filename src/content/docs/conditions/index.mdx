description: Thresholds and situations where continuation inside an environment is no longer neutral.

Conditions is the layer of this site that deals with thresholds.

Foundations defines the vocabulary. Mechanisms explains how influence accumulates. Conditions describes what happens when accumulation crosses a line and the environment begins to bias judgment in a directional way.

A condition is not a mood. It is not a style. It is a stable description of what an environment does to posture over time. Conditions matter because they indicate when remaining inside a field changes more than comfort. It changes tolerance, patience, interpretive bandwidth, and willingness to continue.

This section focuses on moments where continuation stops being a passive default. These are not necessarily dramatic situations. The most common thresholds are quiet. They appear as delay, drift, impatience, and reduced capacity to hold uncertainty.

Read Conditions after Foundations and Mechanisms. Use the pages here as diagnostic lenses. The goal is not to label every space as harmful. The goal is to recognize when a space is actively shaping judgment so that continuation becomes a choice that carries weight.

Start with Environments That Delay Judgment if you want to understand prolonged pre-judgment states. Then read When Continuation Is No Longer Neutral to understand the threshold condition that makes ongoing exposure directional rather than background.
