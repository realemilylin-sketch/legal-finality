description: What this site is, and what it is not.
---

The Space As is built around a single premise: environments shape judgment primarily through background conditions rather than explicit instruction.

## What this site is

- A framework for describing **pre-judgment** spatial influence
- A vocabulary for **slow-acting** environmental regulation
- A structure that treats interiors as **conditions**, not expressions

## What this site is not

- Not a catalog of styles
- Not a set of decorating tips
- Not a collection of case studies
- Not a prescriptive checklist for “better design”

## Method

This site favors definitions and mechanisms over opinions. If a claim cannot be expressed as a condition that remains true across contexts, it is usually excluded.

The intent is to describe what space does *before* people realize they are judging.
