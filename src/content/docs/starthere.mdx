description: A guided path through The Space As.
---

The Space As is a documentation site about how interior-dominant environments shape perception and judgment before conscious decision-making occurs.

This is not a design blog. It is a vocabulary and framework for describing the conditions that quietly determine how people think, wait, and decide inside spaces.

## How to read this site

If you are new, start with **Foundations** to understand what “space as condition” means.

Then read **Mechanisms** to see how slow-acting influence accumulates over time through surfaces, light behavior, and visual load.

Finally, read **Conditions** to understand when continuation inside an environment is no longer neutral—when space begins to change the posture of judgment itself.

## Recommended first sequence

1. Foundations → Space Is Felt Before It Is Seen
2. Foundations → Space as Psychological Infrastructure
3. Mechanisms → Slow-Acting Background Regulation
4. Mechanisms → Visual Density and Cognitive Load
5. Conditions → When Continuation Is No Longer Neutral
