description: Notes on the site, its structure, and how it is maintained.
---

This site is organized as a small documentation system rather than a blog.

## Structure

The content is grouped into three layers:

- **Foundations**: definitions and first principles
- **Mechanisms**: how influence accumulates over time
- **Conditions**: when continuation inside an environment becomes non-neutral

## Publishing approach

The site prioritizes clarity and stability over frequency. Pages are intended to remain valid after revision cycles, with minimal reliance on time-sensitive commentary.

## Technology

Built with Astro and Starlight, using the Flexoki theme for long-form readability.
